# SCE Master Plan

## 1. Project identity

- Product: Shift Tools
- Short name: SCE
- Codename: Nightingale
- Initial release target: 1.0
- Framework: Flutter
- Primary language: Dart

## 2. Mission

Create a reliable shift management platform that reads roster data from Google Sheets,
understands hospital-specific shift relationships and colors, validates business rules,
and synchronizes only confirmed changes to Google Calendar.

## 3. Core principles

1. Accuracy before automation.
2. The system must not guess unknown business rules.
3. Every synchronization must have a preview.
4. Source spreadsheets are read-only.
5. Every Calendar event must have a stable Sync ID.
6. Every change must be traceable.
7. Configuration is preferred over hardcoding.
8. Business rules must not live in UI widgets.
9. Google APIs must not be called directly from widgets.
10. Parser, rule engine, and calendar engine remain separate.

## 4. User flow

```text
เลือกไฟล์ตารางเวร

[เลือกไฟล์ต้นฉบับ]
[เลือกไฟล์ปัจจุบัน]
[เปรียบเทียบไฟล์]
[อัปเดต Google Calendar]
```

Files are selected through Google Drive Picker.

## 5. Architecture

```text
Presentation
  -> Application Use Cases
  -> Domain Models and Rules
  -> Infrastructure / Google APIs / Local Storage
```

Feature modules:

- Authentication
- Google Drive
- Google Sheets
- Shift Parser
- Relationship Engine
- Business Rule Engine
- Simulation
- Diff Engine
- Calendar Engine
- History
- Dashboard
- Reports
- Settings

## 6. Shift relationship model

Every parsed shift must be able to represent:

- Original Owner
- Actual Worker
- Transfer From
- Transfer To
- Relationship Type
- Status
- Source cell
- Source sheet
- Source spreadsheet
- Start and end date-time
- Background color
- Stable Sync ID

## 7. Synchronization behavior

The Calendar synchronization engine must operate by diff:

- Add new events
- Update changed events
- Delete events that no longer belong to the user
- Leave unchanged events untouched

Never delete and rebuild the entire calendar as a normal synchronization strategy.

## 8. Delivery support policy

The current stabilization target is deliberately limited to two active delivery
surfaces:

```text
main
├── Windows        ACTIVE
├── Website        ACTIVE
├── Android       PAUSED
├── iOS            PAUSED
├── macOS          PAUSED
└── Linux          PAUSED
```

Windows x64 and Web/GitHub Pages are the only active release targets. Android,
iOS, macOS, and Linux remain preserved in `main` where their source is useful,
but they are not merge or release gates. They may be restored later through an
explicit, isolated verification cycle.

The detailed delivery state is maintained in `docs/DELIVERY_STATUS.md` and the
workflow support contract in `.github/workflows/README.md`.

## 9. CI/release contract

The active release surface is:

- `.github/workflows/windows.yml` — Windows x64 release ZIP and SHA-256 checksum.
- `.github/workflows/web.yml` — Flutter Web release artifact and GitHub Pages deployment.

The stabilization state is recorded as Format PASS, Analyze PASS, Test PASS,
Coverage PASS, Artifact PASS, Windows PASS, Website PASS, and Final Gate PASS.
These checks describe the accepted verification state; they are not a reason
to reintroduce a broad platform matrix.

Failure-containment rules:

1. A paused platform must never block Windows or Web.
2. Missing `integration_test/` must never fail a supported release workflow.
3. `coverage/lcov.info` is not a required artifact of Windows/Web release workflows.
4. Formatting changes are committed explicitly, not auto-committed by release gates.
5. Windows and Web workflows remain independent.

## 10. Roadmap

- overnight validation;
- conflicts and missing data.

### Sprint 4 — Calendar synchronization
- simulation;
- diff;
- preview;
- add/update/delete;
- extended properties;
- history.

### Sprint 5 — Dashboard and reports
- shift counts;
- working hours;
- OT;
- received/given shifts;
- history;
- PDF and spreadsheet exports.

### Sprint 6 — Production release
- security review;
- integration tests;
- multi-platform builds;
- release 1.0.

## 11. Definition of Done

A feature is complete only when:

- implementation is finished;
- `flutter analyze` passes;
- relevant unit tests pass;
- relevant widget tests pass;
- user-facing errors are understandable;
- documentation is updated;
- changelog is updated;
- an ADR exists when architecture changed.

## 12. Immediate next milestone

Maintain the reduced Windows + Web delivery surface, keep paused platform code
preserved in `main`, and only restore another platform after an explicit
platform-specific verification cycle.
