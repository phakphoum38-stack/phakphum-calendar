# SCE Master Plan

## 1. Project identity

- Product: Shift Calendar Engine
- Short name: SCE
- Codename: Nightingale
- Initial release target: 1.0
- Framework: Flutter
- Primary language: Dart

## 2. Mission

Create a reliable shift management platform that reads roster data from Google Sheets,
understands hospital-specific shift relationships and colors, validates business rules,
and synchronizes only confirmed changes to Google Calendar.

## 3. Core principles

1. Accuracy before automation.
2. The system must not guess unknown business rules.
3. Every synchronization must have a preview.
4. Source spreadsheets are read-only.
5. Every Calendar event must have a stable Sync ID.
6. Every change must be traceable.
7. Configuration is preferred over hardcoding.
8. Business rules must not live in UI widgets.
9. Google APIs must not be called directly from widgets.
10. Parser, rule engine, and calendar engine remain separate.

## 4. User flow

```text
เลือกไฟล์ตารางเวร

[เลือกไฟล์ต้นฉบับ]
[เลือกไฟล์ปัจจุบัน]
[เปรียบเทียบไฟล์]
[อัปเดต Google Calendar]
```

Files are selected through Google Drive Picker.

## 5. Architecture

```text

  -> Application Use Cases
  -> Domain Models and Rules
  -> Infrastructure / Google APIs / Local Storage
```

Feature modules:

- Authentication
- Google Drive
- Google Sheets
- Shift Parser
- Relationship Engine
- Business Rule Engine
- Simulation
- Diff Engine
- Calendar Engine
- History
- Dashboard
- Reports
- Settings

## 6. Shift relationship model

Every parsed shift must be able to represent:

- Original Owner
- Actual Worker
- Transfer From
- Transfer To
- Relationship Type
- Status
- Source cell
- Source sheet
- Source spreadsheet
- Start and end date-time
- Background color
- Stable Sync ID

## 7. Synchronization behavior

The Calendar synchronization engine must operate by diff:

- Add new events
- Update changed events
- Delete events that no longer belong to the user
- Leave unchanged events untouched

Never delete and rebuild the entire calendar as a normal synchronization strategy.

## 8. Roadmap

### Sprint 0 — Foundation
- project structure;
- documentation;
- coding rules;
- ADR system;
- base models;
- CI templates;
- test framework.

### Sprint 1 — Google integration
- Google Sign-In;
- Drive Picker;
- Sheets API;
- Calendar API;
- OAuth configuration guide.

### Sprint 2 — Shift parser
- dates;
- names;
- background colors;
- merged cells;
- normalized ShiftRecord.

### Sprint 3 — Relationships and rules
- own shift;
- received shift;
- given-away shift;
- major exchange;
- clinic exchange;
- borrowed name;
- overnight validation;
- conflicts and missing data.

### Sprint 4 — Calendar synchronization
- simulation;
- diff;
- preview;
- add/update/delete;
- extended properties;
- history.

### Sprint 5 — Dashboard and reports
- shift counts;
- working hours;
- OT;
- received/given shifts;
- history;
- PDF and spreadsheet exports.

### Sprint 6 — Production release
- security review;
- integration tests;
- multi-platform builds;
- release 1.0.

## 9. Definition of Done

A feature is complete only when:

- implementation is finished;
- `flutter analyze` passes;
- relevant unit tests pass;
- relevant widget tests pass;
- user-facing errors are understandable;
- documentation is updated;
- changelog is updated;
- an ADR exists when architecture changed.

## 10. Immediate next milestone

Create a valid Flutter project around this foundation, select state management and
dependency injection through ADRs, then implement immutable domain models and parser contracts.
