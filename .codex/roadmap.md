# Shift Tools Roadmap

## Sprint 0 — Foundation

Status: Completed

- Rebrand the user-facing application to Shift Tools.
- Preserve package IDs, bundle IDs, and import paths.

- Create the initial clean feature folder structure.

## Sprint 1 — Excel Import

Status: Completed

- Select and validate `.xlsx` files.
- Read workbooks and choose worksheets.
- Preview the first 50 rows with sparse and merged-cell handling.

  ScheduleDay, and ScheduleMonth entities.

- Manual and automatic assignment foundations.
- Availability, coverage, capacity, and conflict detection.
- Reusable rule engine and validation-result UI.

Remaining:

- Add controllers and documentation for schedule generation workflows.
- Connect validation and generation to the schedule workspace.
- Persist schedules, availability, coverage, capacity, and rules.
- Add user-approved drag-and-drop mutations.

## Sprint 3 — Google Sheets

Status: Next

- Adapt the existing Google Sheets integrations to domain service interfaces.
- Select spreadsheets and worksheets through reusable application use cases.
- Map Sheet data through the same import profile and validation pipeline.
- Preserve read-only defaults and ownership checks.
- Add offline, timeout, permission, and quota handling.

## Sprint 4 — Calendar Integration

Status: Planned

- Adapt existing Google Calendar behavior to `CalendarSyncService`.
- Preview adds, updates, deletions, duplicates, and conflicts.
